Begins with Atychus in the throes of a recurring nightmare.
Includes the basics of magic (specifically minor Theurgy) and religion (creation myth of En worshippers).
Atychus then tries this magic and gets a reaction.
In doing so, he angers Othric, who demands that Atychus remain on Hernasaki for the next 50 years.
Atychus runs away and escapes the island, branding himself an apostate.
