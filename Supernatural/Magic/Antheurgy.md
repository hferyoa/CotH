- "Anti Theurgy"
- Sacriligeous
- Certain God(s) have certain animals that they favour
	- If you _really_ want a favour from a God and don't care about the consequences
	- Capture one of that God's favoured animal, and torture it until its cries attract the God
		- Who would - in theory! - grant you any wish so long as you would stop torturing His/Her beloved beast
