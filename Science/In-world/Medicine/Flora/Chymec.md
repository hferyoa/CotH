- A [[Chymec Evgaric|psychoactive mushroom]] that can be consumed raw for these properties. Effects vary from person to person but include:
	- Sedation
	- Hallucinations
	- Dissociation
- Chymec can also be prepared by drying it out in salt (salt being known as a cleanser), then crumbled into a fire before inhaling the smoke
	- This is often used as a ritual within one's home to commune with the God(s), as homes do not have the natural hallucinatory gases that the Oracles have within caves
